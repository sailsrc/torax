  """Returns the geometry to use during one time step of the simulation.

  A GeometryProvider is any callable (class or function) which takes the
  time of a time step and returns the Geometry for that
  time step. See `SimulationStepFn` for how this callable is used.

  This class is a typing.Protocol, meaning it defines an interface, but any
  function asking for a GeometryProvider as an argument can accept any function
  or class that implements this API without specifically extending this class.

  For instance, the following is an equivalent implementation of the
  ConstantGeometryProvider without actually creating a class, and equally valid.

  .. code-block:: python

    geo = geometry.build_circular_geometry(...)
    constant_geo_provider = lamdba t: geo

    def func_expecting_geo_provider(gp: GeometryProvider):
      ... # do something with the provider.

    func_expecting_geo_provider(constant_geo_provider)  # this works.

    The geometry may change from time step to time step, so the sim needs a
    callable to provide which geometry to use for a given time step (this is
    that callable).

      t: The time at which the geometry is being requested.
